# Publishing your mod {#publishing}

Currently, preferred place to upload your mods to is [Thunderstore.io](https://thunderstore.io/). You're free to use any
platform but Thunderstore is recommended.

## Create Thunderstore Team {#create-team}

To upload mods to Thunderstore you will have to make an account. After that's done you have to create a team.

![Steps for creating a team](/images/publishing/packaging/create_team.webp)

- Click on `Settings` button next to your username
- Go to `Teams` tab under `Account settings`
- Press `Create Team`
- Now give your team a name
    - Using your username is totally fine, unless you actually have a team with a name.
