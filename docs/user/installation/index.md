# Installing Mods

Mods can be installed from any place you find them, _but_,
it's recommended to download them from [Thunderstore.io](https://thunderstore.io/c/mycopunk/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Mycopunk/) Mycopunk page,
since this is the place we've decided on.

## Installation Methods

You have a few options when it comes to installing mods:
- Using a mod manager that works with Thunderstore (**Recommended**)
- Manually installing mods
