# Profiles

Profiles allow you to easily separate your mods, think of it as Minecraft modpacks.
For now, you can just use the `Default` profile, but when you decide to start separating your mods,
you can use `Create new` button to make a new profile which won't have any mods by default.

Another useful feature of profiles, is that you can share them with other people.

## Importing profiles

To import someone else's profile, press `Import/Update` button on profile selection screen
and use the `From code` option where you will be able to enter the code you have.

## Exporting profiles

If you want to share your profile, you can do that by going to `Settings`,
selecting the `Profile` tab and using the `Export profile as code` option.
This will copy a code to clipboard that you can now paste somewhere to share.
