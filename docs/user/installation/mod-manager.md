# Using a mod manager
---

You can use any mod manager that supports Thunderstore. Here are the most popular ones:
- [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/mycopunk/p/ebkr/r2modman/)
- [Gale](https://github.com/Kesomannen/gale)
- [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/thunderstore-thunderstore_mod_manager)

For this guide we will use `r2modman`, but steps should be the same for other ones.

## Installing a mod manager

Go to a download page of your selected mod manager and follow the instructions.

In case of `Gale` and `r2modman`, all you have to do is press `Manual Download` and follow the installer instructions.

## Installing mods

Before installing mods you first have to select the game you want to install mods for.

To do so, just type `Mycopunk` in the search bar,
while hovering over the card you can add the game to favorites (star in top right) so it's easier to select next time,
now you can click `Select game` which will show you the next screen.

When asked about which profile to use, go with `Select profile` for now.

## Playing with mods

After you done installing mods you want, in order to launch the game with mods, you have to use `Start modded` button in top left.

If everything went smoothly you should see a game launch, if not - consult [FAQ]() or ask for help on discord.
